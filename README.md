# Combining Optimization with Learning for Procedural Content Generation

We study three scenarios:

- Use MILP solver to generate more training data

- Use MILP solver to fix the generated levels 

- Use Mipaal in the GAN

Acknowledgement: We thank our colleagues from ITU university for creating the original levels. We thank Aaron Ferber for proving [MIPaal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05912) code.

Instructions
- Clone the repo
- git submodule init update
